## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for:

- spec improvements
- examples and templates
- tooling integrations
- documentation quality
- security guidance

## Suggested Workflow

1. Open an issue describing the proposal or bug.
2. Keep proposals concrete: problem, constraints, and expected behavior.
3. Submit a pull request with focused scope and clear rationale.
4. Include before/after examples for spec-affecting changes.
5. Request review and address feedback incrementally.

## Recommended Repo Conventions

- Keep normative spec text explicit (`MUST`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`).
- Separate examples from normative requirements.
- Add changelog entries for behavior-impacting edits.

## Governance Notes

- Security-sensitive changes should require at least one security-minded reviewer.
- Changes to bootstrap behavior should include migration guidance.
- Backward compatibility should be preserved unless deprecation is clearly communicated.

## Communication

Use the repository issue tracker and discussion threads as the canonical channels for:

- roadmap proposals
- implementation questions
- interop reports across agent frameworks
